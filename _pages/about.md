Hi there!

I'm a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, pursuing my Master's in Data Science. My interests centers around software, systems and infrastructure that power data science and big data workflows. My other interests are in the area of algorithms, cloud and distributed systems.

Before my master's, I was a part of Tata Consultancy Services, working at the intersection of Software, Data Science and MLOps. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also inspired me to pursue my master's. Lately I've also been exploring DevOps and SRE.

In a nutshell, I'm on a mission to make data science faster and more reliable. Thanks for visiting my space!
